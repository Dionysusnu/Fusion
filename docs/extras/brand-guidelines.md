Fusion is a modern, lightweight library built to make UI development faster and
accessible to more people.

The Fusion brand is designed to reflect these themes.

## Elements

!!! note "Stub"
	This section is a stub - it may require more detail added to it in future.

### The Fusion logo

Our logo is constructed from two perpendicular intersecting planes, viewed from
an almost-isometric angle. 

This represents how Fusion brings together two different data structures into
one unified whole; Fusion connects the hierachy of instances to the hierachy of state objects.

The logo is designed on an 8x8 pixel grid, making it highly legible and
recognisable at almost any size.

The colours chosen are energetic and warm, giving Fusion a uniquely hot colour
palette compared to the cool blues of most other libraries and frameworks.

Itâ€™s a simple, abstract design, but stands out among many other Roblox libraries
by not depending on the Roblox brand.

## Using Fusion brand assets

Before using the Fusion logo or brand assets in your project, please be mindful
of our policy around use of our branding. The rights to the Fusion name, logo
and brand assets remain reserved by Elttob.

By default, with the sole exception of any use case explicitly cleared here, you
must receive explicit written permission from Elttob if you are looking to use
the Fusion name, logo or brand assets.

We explicitly clear one use of these assets, such that prior consent is not
required for only this use case:

- Representing the **base, unmodified** Fusion project. For example, you may use the
the Fusion logo on-screen in a tutorial video when you're referring to the
Fusion project, as an image in a news article or blog post where you are talking
about the Fusion project, as an icon in a data visualisation to represent the
Fusion project, and any other uses where it is very clear that the use of the
assets, logo or name is representing the base, unmodified Fusion project.

We explicitly reject the following uses of these assets:

- Using the Fusion logo, name or brand assets for anything which is not the base,
unmodified Fusion project (unless prior explicit written consent was given by
Elttob).
In particular, without prior consent, you may *not* use the Fusion logo to
represent your third-party library, software, plugin or game.
- Using the Fusion logo, name or brand assets in a way which does not
sufficiently distinguish you from the Fusion project, or using these in a way
which may insinuate support, endorsement or other affiliation with the Fusion
project.

In any case, please get in contact if you would like to use the Fusion branding
for any use case other than what we have explicitly cleared.
